# Lost in Cultural Translation: Do LLMs Struggle with Math Across Cultural Contexts?

This repository accompanies our research paper, *Lost in Cultural Translation: Do LLMs Struggle with Math Across Cultural Contexts?* In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can maintain stable performance on mathematical problem solving when faced with culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K dataset.

**Overview:**
- **Paper:** The study evaluates the impact of cultural and linguistic variations on mathematical reasoning by adapting the GSM8K dataset to create six regional variants.
- **Key Findings:** Although mathematical principles remain constant, performance varies across cultural contextsâ€”highlighting the role of cultural familiarity challenges in shaping model mathematical reasoning outcomes.
- **Future Uploads:** Data and clean code used in our experiments will be uploaded here in the near future.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out with questions or comments!
